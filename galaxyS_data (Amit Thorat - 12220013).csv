Like the other commenter said. The ultra series is the note replacement from the s21u and on. The only difference with that is you get an s pen that adds some features. Outside of that there is nothing special. The note series had a different more square design compared to the s series. The notes generally got a slightly updated soc with newer software.

Luckily for me I had filmed myself packaging the device and displayed it's perfect condition on the video before packaging it.

Then I also contacted the carrier through a chat to get a confirmation that Samsung did indeed receive it and even signed it as received.

On top of this I had also saved all support chats and their return instructions to prove that I returned it correctly to the correct address. With all of this I contacted them attaching all device and threatening to make a complaint to my local and EU consumer centers (as I live in EU).

Only then did they stop sending the same generic email responses and forwarded me to their managers in EU who then quickly contacted me and promised to give a full refund within 30 days with all the proof I provided.

Still waiting for that refund as 30 days hasn't passed (30 days would be the norm also of they received my device normally so nothing out of ordinary here), but I am hopeful and in anycase I now have a email from their manager promising me the refund and their official automatic confirmation email.

All in all this has as well taken 3 months and despite finally being promised a refund I will never again use Samsung - atleast through their official stores.

UPDATE: Trying to return a Galaxy S23 has never made me feel so disrespected,Flopdoodledo,3,184,274,545,270,"I remember in the old days if there was an issue with your Samsung phone that fell under warranty and that required you to send your phone in, they would just send you a new device. You could then transfer all of your content to your new device, send the old one in, and be done.

Now they want you to send in your device first before they make a decision on replacement, which would leave you without a phone for 2-6 weeks. Obviously in today's world, that's not feasible lol. 

I'm sure a few people received the new phone and never sent the other one in (stealing), which caused loss in revenue. However, could it really have been that much to completely massively inconvenience an entire customer base?

The combination of high-end camera hardware/amazing suite of video/photo apps with the audio jack/built-in DAC/ system audio optimizations have converted me.

Did I mention my Xperia has a SD card slot? Yeah. Transitioning from a S9+ to an Xperia was seamless. 

The build construction is also astounding. On par with Apple. I owned a LG V60 in between both phones that had similar features to the Sony, and that thing felt janky and fragile in comparison (plastic vs. metal frame).

The only thing Samsung has over Sony is that the screens on their phones are bigger. I've come to like a smaller form factor, the Japanese chocolate bar shape works for me despite my big paws and I don't depend on an accessory (popsocket, phone loop, etc.) to hold my phone one-handed, but I can see it being a dealbreaker for people who use their phone primarily for video consumption.

I got an S23U in November (delivered late) and it arrived already blocked by Samsung as it had been ""reported as lost, stolen or undelivered"" - not by me!

Over 15 (multiple hours long) calls and countless emails later, I have an ongoing dispute on PayPal for it and they're definitely dragging their heels as the resolution date has been pushed back multiple times from the middle of December and is now the 6th of January.

I'm in a lucky enough position that I could go to Argos and buy an S23U from them directly (so I could take it back to a store if I have issues - we don't have Samsung stores here in Ireland) but I'm still over £1,000 down, with what amounts to a very expensive paperweight, until PayPal sort it out for me.",Negative,-0.4003,457,<FreqDist with 55 samples and 63 outcomes>

However, I will say:

1) Both friend and my phone are PIN locked (Mine is face recognition or PIN).  
2) I've never done anything on her phone on ONE-landness.  All I've done is held her phone in my hand if she's showing me some photo or needed help getting on her own WiFi (she's not at all tech savvy, whereas I set up her business WiFi and help with all things tech).  Or picked it up mistakenly thinking it was mine ( and vice versa) but as soon as I see the lock screen, I know it's the wrong phone.

I suppose ""Stranger Things"" have happened in the world, so I absolutely WILL heed your suggestion (though I'm not optimistic 🤔).  

Does ONE (even try to) do any AI antics (say like FB) and figure out by proximity - suggesting her as a friend to share photos with or anything?   I will confess, I have more than once dismissed an Android toast or notification without reading it.

It was great overall, but the one flaw is what most mattered to me, and that is night picture/video quality.

Night photos were okay most of the time, but were unusually noisy. If you shoot a bright scene with a dark sky, most of the time the sky was so noisy that the photo was unusable.

Videos during daytime were fine, but if the lighting becomes even the slightest bit challenging, it was just full of noise. An IPhone 7 takes better low-light videos than the S21U.

Zoom was awesome though, along with the screen and battery.

Setting Up Automations,nevinsz,21,43,57,97,4,"Saw that you are asking for Galaxy S Note (hope it's a Samsung Ultra phone or a Note 10 at least running one of the newer android versions(android 13 or 14) else the below solution might not work)

I dont think you can set higher volume for specific apps. What you can do is set a mode from 8pm to 8am and ask it to read notification aloud for your email app. 

An alternative would be to set an automation/routine to increase ALL notification volume during this period (like if you usually keep it at 80% you can make the volume at 100% for that period but that would be for all apps). 

Another workaround that I can think of right now is that along with automation from my last point you can block notifications from other apps so you can only get email notifications for that period (or set a separate tone for email apps so you know when you get an email notification).

Will try to play around a bit with my phone tonight and update here if I find such a setting.

P.S.- Anyone please correct me and let me know if I'm wrong and if there's any other way",Negative,-0.1655,68,<FreqDist with 74 samples and 97 outcomes>
